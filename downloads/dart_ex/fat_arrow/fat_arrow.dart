 * Fat-arrow function or lambda expession is a clean way to write a function expression on a single line.
 * Fat-arrow functions doesn't have a statements body `{}`.
 * The statement body is replaced with `=>` fat-arrow which points to a single statement.
 *
 * This statement is executed when the fat-arrow function is called and
 * it always returns the result of the statement execution.
